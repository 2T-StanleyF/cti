Mobile Phishing is a variation on the Phishing social engineering technique where the attack is initiated via mobile texting rather than email. The user is enticed to provide information or go to a compromised web site via a text message. Apart from the manner in which the attack is initiated, the attack proceeds as a standard Phishing attack.",
