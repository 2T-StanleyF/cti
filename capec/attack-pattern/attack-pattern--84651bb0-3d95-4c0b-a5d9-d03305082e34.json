    "description": "An attacker searches a targeted web site for web pages that have not been publicized. Generally this involves mapping the published web site by spidering through all the published links and then attempt to access well-known debugging or logging pages, or otherwise predictable pages within the site tree. For example, if an attacker might be able to notice a pattern in the naming of documents and extrapolate this pattern to discover additional documents that have been created but are no longer externally linked. Using this, the attacker may be able to gain access to information that the targeted site did not intend to make public.",
