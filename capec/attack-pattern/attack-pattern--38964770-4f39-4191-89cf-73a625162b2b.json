            "description": "This type of attack targets the communication between two components (typically client and server). The attacker places themself in the communication channel between the two components. Whenever one component attempts to communicate with the other (data flow, authentication challenges, etc.), the data first goes to the attacker, who has the opportunity to observe or alter it, and it is then passed on to the other component as if it was never observed. This interposition is transparent leaving the two compromised components unaware of the potential corruption or leakage of their communications. The potential for Man-in-the-Middle attacks yields an implicit lack of trust in communication or identify between two components. MITM attacks differ from sniffing attacks since they often modify the communications prior to delivering it to the intended recipient. These attacks also differ from interception attacks since they may forward the sender's original unmodified data, after copying it, instead of keeping it for themselves.",

The initial compromise of this attack is generally a Trojan delivered to a victim's system via phishing attacks, drive-by malware installations, or malicious browser extensions. Once the Trojan is on the victim system, the adversary can observe and intercept traffic such as cookies, HTTP sessions, and SSL client certificate, which may allow for browser pivoting into an authenticated session. MITB attacks also circumvent common security mechanisms such as two and three factor authentication, as well as SSL/PKI.</xhtml:p>\n               <xhtml:p>For example, after installing a Trojan, an adversary positions themself between the victim and their banking institution. The victim begins by initiating a funds transfer from their personal savings to their personal checking account. Using injected JavaScript, the adversary captures this request and modifies it to transfer an increased amount of funds to an account that they controls, before sending it to the bank. The bank processes the transfer and sends the confirmation notice back to the victim, which is instead intercepted by the adversary. The adversary modifies the confirmation to reflect the original transaction details and sends this modified message back to the victim. Upon receiving the confirmation, the victim assumes the transfer was successful and is unaware that their money has just been transferred to the adversary.</xhtml:p>\n            "
