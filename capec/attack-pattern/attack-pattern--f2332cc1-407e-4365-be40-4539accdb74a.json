On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003/R2, the program (e.g. \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\utilman.exe\") may be replaced with cmd.exe (or another program that provides backdoor access). Then pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while sitting at the keyboard or when connected over RDP will cause the replaced file to be executed with SYSTEM privileges."
