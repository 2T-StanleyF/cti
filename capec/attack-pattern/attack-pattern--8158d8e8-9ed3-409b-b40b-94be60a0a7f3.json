    "name": "Terrestrial Jamming",
    "description": "In this attack pattern, the adversary transmits disruptive signals in the direction of the target consumer-level satellite dish (as opposed to the satellite itself). The transmission disruption occurs in a more targeted range. Portable terrestrial jammers have a range of 3-5 kilometers in urban areas and 20 kilometers in rural areas. This technique requires a terrestrial jammer that is more powerful than the frequencies sent from the satellite.",
