    "description": "Adversaries may attempt to identify the primary users of the system. They may do this, for example, by reviewing logins or file modification times. An example Windows command that may accomplish this is \"dir /A ntuser.dat\". Which will display the last modified time of a user's ntuser.dat file when run within the root folder of a user. This time is synonymous with the last time that user was logged in. Administrator permissions are required to view the home folder of other users.",
