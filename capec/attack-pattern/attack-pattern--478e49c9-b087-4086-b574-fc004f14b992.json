    "description": "An attacker tampers with the code of a product and injects malicious logic into the device in order to infect any machine which interfaces with the product, and possibly steal private data or eavesdrop. With the proliferation of mass digital storage and inexpensive multimedia devices, Bluetooth and 802.11 support, new attack vectors for spreading malware are emerging for things we once thought of as innocuous greeting cards, picture frames, or digital projectors becomes important vectors of attack.",
