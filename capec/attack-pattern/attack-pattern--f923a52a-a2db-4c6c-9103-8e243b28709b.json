    "description": "The adversary uses disruptive signals or events (e.g. electromagnetic pulses, laser pulses, clock glitches, etc.) to cause faulty behavior in electronic devices. When performed in a controlled manner on devices performing cryptographic operations, this faulty behavior can be exploited to derive secret key information.",
