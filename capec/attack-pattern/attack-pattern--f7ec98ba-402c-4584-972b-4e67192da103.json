    "name": "Malicious Logic Insertion into Product Software via Inclusion of 3rd Party Component Dependency",
    "description": "An attacker conducts supply chain attacks by the inclusion of insecure 3rd party components into a technology, product, or code-base, possibly packaging a malicious driver or component along with the product before shipping it to the consumer or acquirer. The result is a window of opportunity for exploiting the product or software until the insecure component is discovered. This supply chain threat can result in the installation of software that introduces widespread security vulnerabilities within an organization. One example could be the inclusion of an exploitable DLL (Dynamic Link Library) included within an antivirus technology. Because software often depends upon a large number of interdependent libraries and components to be present, security holes can be introduced merely by installing COTS software that comes pre-packaged with the components required for it to operate.",
