Calling these services, or extending them for one's own (perhaps very different) purposes is as easy as knowing they exist. Their unencumbered public use, however, is a purposeful aspect of Google's business model. Most organizations, however, do not have the same business model. Organizations publishing services usually fall back on thoughts that Attackers \"will not know services exist\" and that \"even if they did, they wouldn't be able to access them because they're not on the local LAN.\" Simple threat modeling exercises usually uncovers simple attack vectors that can invalidate these assumptions."

The service need not be 'discoverable', but in the event it isn't it must have some way of being discovered by an attacker. This might include listening on a well-known port. Ultimately, the likelihood of exploit depends on discoverability of the vulnerable service."
