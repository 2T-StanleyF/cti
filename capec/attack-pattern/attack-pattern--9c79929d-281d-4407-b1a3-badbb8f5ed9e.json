        "An attacker has access to an organization's warehouse of card readers being included as a part of an overall security system. By replacing a critical hardware component in the card reader, the attacker is able to alter the function of the card reader to allow an attacker-supplied card to bypass a security checkpoint. The card reader is placed in the warehouse, and later used in the victim's security system. The attacker is then able to go to the victim and use their own card and bypass a physical security checkpoint and gain access to the victim's location for further malicious activity."
