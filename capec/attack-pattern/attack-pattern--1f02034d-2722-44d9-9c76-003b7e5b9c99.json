    "description": "An adversary sends a malicious (\"NXDOMAIN\" (\"No such domain\") code, or DNS A record) response to a targets route request before a legitimate resolver can. This technique requires an On-path or In-path device that can monitor and respond to the targets DNS requests. This attack differs from BGP Tampering in that it directly responds to requests made by the target instead of polluting the routing the targets infrastructure uses.",
