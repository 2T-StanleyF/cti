    "description": "An adversary, through a previously installed malicious application, intercepts an implicit intent sent to launch a trusted activity and instead launches a counterfeit activity in its place. The malicious activity is then used to mimic the trusted activity's user interface and convince the user to enter sensitive data as if they were interacting with the trusted activity.",
