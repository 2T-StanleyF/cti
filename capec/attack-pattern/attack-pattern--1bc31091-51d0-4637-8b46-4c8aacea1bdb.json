    "description": "An adversary provides data under a falsified identity. The purpose of using the falsified identity may be to prevent traceability of the provided data or it might be an attempt by the adversary to assume the rights granted to another identity. One of the simplest forms of this attack would be the creation of an email message with a modified \"From\" field in order to appear that the message was sent from someone other than the actual sender. Results of the attack vary depending on the details of the attack, but common results include privilege escalation, obfuscation of other attacks, and data corruption/manipulation.",

        "The target application must associate data with its source. This association could be as simple as logging the source of the data (in which case this attack seeks to create a false trail in the log) or the target application could associate some increased level of access with certain identities (in which case an attacker might seek to impersonate those identities in order to increase privileges)."

Possible tools needed by an attacker could include tools to create custom network packets, specific client software, and tools to capture network traffic. Many variants of this attack require no attacker resources, however."
