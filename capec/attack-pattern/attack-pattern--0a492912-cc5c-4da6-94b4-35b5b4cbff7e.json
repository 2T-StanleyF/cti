    "description": "An adversary monitors network traffic between nodes of a public or multicast network in an attempt to capture sensitive information. The adversary doesn't prevent reception or change content but simply observes and reads the traffic. The attacker might precipitate or indirectly influence the content of the observed transaction, but the attacker is never the intended recipient of the information.",
