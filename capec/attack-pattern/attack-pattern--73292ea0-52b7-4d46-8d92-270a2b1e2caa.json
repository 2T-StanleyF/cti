    "name": "SOAP Parameter Tampering",
    "description": "An attacker sends a SOAP message where the field values are other than what the server is likely to expect in order to precipitate non-standard server behavior. In a SOAP message, parameters take the form of values within XML elements. The server will have an XML schema that indicates certain restrictions on these parameter values. For example, the server may expect a parameter to be a string with fewer than 10 characters, or a number less than 100. In a SOAP parameter tampering attack, an attacker either violates this schema, or takes advantage of flexibility within the scheme (for example, a lack of a character limit) to provide parameters that a server might not expect. Examples of unexpected parameters include oversized data, data with different data types, inserting metacharacters within data, and sending contextually inappropriate data (for example, sending a non-existent product name in a product name field or using an out-of-order sequence number). Results of this attack can include information disclosure, denial of service, or even execution of arbitrary code.",
