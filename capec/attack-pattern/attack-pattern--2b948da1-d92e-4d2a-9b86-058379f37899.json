    "description": "This attack exploits certain XML parsers which manage data in an inefficient manner. The attacker crafts an \n                  XML document with many attributes in the same XML node. In a vulnerable parser, this results in a denial of service condition \n                  owhere CPU resources are exhausted because of the parsing algorithm.",
