    "name": "Homograph Attack via Homoglyphs",
    "description": "An adversary registers a domain name containing a homoglyph, leading the registered domain to appear the same as a trusted domain. A homograph attack leverages the fact that different characters among various character sets look the same to the user. Homograph attacks must generally be combined with other attacks, such as phishing attacks, in order to direct Internet traffic to the adversary-controlled destinations.",

The adversary can now use the user's legitimate bankofamerica.com credentials to log into the user's account and steal any money which may be in the account.\nHomograph vulnerability allows an adversary to impersonate a trusted domain by leveraging homoglyphs and tricking a user into visiting the malicious website to steal user credentials."
