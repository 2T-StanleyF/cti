Their unencumbered public use, however, is a purposeful aspect of Google's business model. Most organizations, however, do not have the same business model. Organizations publishing services usually fall back on thoughts that Attackers \"will not know services exist\" and that \"even if they did, they wouldn't be able to access them because they're not on the local LAN.\" Simple threat modeling exercises usually uncovers simple attack vectors that can invalidate these assumptions."
