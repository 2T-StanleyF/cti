    "description": "Software packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an executable. The act of packing an executable changes the file signature in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection. Most decompression techniques decompress the executable code in memory. Utilities used to perform software packing are called packers. Example packers are MPRESS and UPX. A more comprehensive list of known packers is available, but adversaries may create their own packing techniques to evade defenses that do not leave the same artifacts as well-known packers.",
