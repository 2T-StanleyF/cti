    "description": "An attacker manipulates functions and/or their values used by web-related protocols to cause a web application or service to react differently that intended, allowing the attacker to gain access to data or resources normally restricted or to cause the application or service to crash. This can either be performed through the manipulation of call parameters with unexpected values or by calling functions that should normally be restricted or limited.",
