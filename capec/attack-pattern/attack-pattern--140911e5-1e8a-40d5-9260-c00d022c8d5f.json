The attacker sends the victim an email stating that the existing networking card is faulty, and that the victim can order a replacement card free of charge. The victim orders the card, and the attacker sends the malicious networking card. The malicious networking card replaces the perfectly-functioning original networking card, and the attacker is able to take advantage of the additional malicious functionality to further compromise the victim's network."
