External entity references can take \n                  the form of <!ENTITY name system \"uri\"> tags in a DTD. Because processors may not validate documents with external entities, \n                  there may be no checks on the nature of the reference in the external entity. This can allow an attacker to open arbitrary \n                  files or connections.\n               ",
