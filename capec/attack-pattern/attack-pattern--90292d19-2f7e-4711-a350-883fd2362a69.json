    "description": "In this attack scenario, the attacker imitates a cellular base station with his own \u201crogue\u201d base station equipment. Since cellular devices connect to whatever station has the strongest signal, the attacker can easily convince a targeted cellular device (e.g. the retransmission device) to talk to the rogue base station.",
