    "description": "An attacker can craft special user-controllable input consisting of XPath expressions to inject the XML database and bypass authentication\n                  or glean information that he normally would not be able to. XPath Injection enables an attacker to talk directly to the XML database, \n                  thus bypassing the application completely. XPath Injection results from the failure of an application to properly sanitize input used as \n                  part of dynamic XPath expressions used to query an XML database.",

This can be achieved by injecting the query to the XML database with XPath syntax that causes the authentication check to fail. Improper validation of user-controllable input and use of a non-parameterized XPath expression enable the attacker to inject an XPath expression that causes authentication bypass."
