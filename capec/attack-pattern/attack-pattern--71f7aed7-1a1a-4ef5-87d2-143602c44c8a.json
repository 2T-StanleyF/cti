        "An attacker wishes to bypass a security system to access an additional network segment where critical data is kept. The attacker knows that some configurations of the security system will allow for remote bypass under certain conditions, such as switching a specific parameter to a different value. The attacker knows the bypass will work but also will be detected within the logging data of the security system. The attacker waits until an upgrade is performed to the security system by the victim's system administrators, and the attacker has access to an external logging system. The attacker injects false log entries that cause the administrators to think there are two different error states within the security system - one involving the specific parameter and the other involving the logging entries. The specific parameter is adjusted to a different value, and the logging level is reduced to a lower level that will not cause an attacker bypass to be detected. The attacker stops injecting false log data, and the administrators of the security system believe the issues were caused by the upgrade and are now resolved. The attacker is then able to bypass the security system."
