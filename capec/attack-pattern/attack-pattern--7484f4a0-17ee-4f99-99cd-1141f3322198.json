    "description": "An attacker changes or replaces a hardware component which undermines the system's integrity for the purpose of carrying out an attack. After deployment, it is not uncommon for upgrades and replacements to occur involving hardware and various replaceable parts. These upgrades and replacements are intended to correct defects, provide additional features, and to replace broken or worn-out parts. However, by forcing or tricking the replacement of a good component with a defective or corrupted component, an attacker can leverage known defects to obtain a desired malicious impact.",
