    "description": "Design: Follow the defensive programming practices needed to protect an application accessing the database from SQL injection\nConfiguration: Ensure that the DBMS is patched with the latest security patches\nDesign: Ensure that the DBMS login used by the application has the lowest possible level of privileges in the DBMS\nDesign: Ensure that DBMS runs with the lowest possible level of privileges on the host machine and that it runs as a separate user\nUsage: Do not use the DBMS machine for anything else other than the database\nUsage: Do not place any trust in the database host on the internal network. Authenticate and validate all network activity originating from the database host.\nUsage: Use an intrusion detection system to monitor network connections and logs on the database host.\nImplementation: Remove / disable all unneeded / unused functions of the DBMS system that may allow an attacker to elevate privileges if compromised",
