    "description": "Do not enable the feature of \"Hidden SSIDs\u201d (also known as \u201cNetwork Cloaking\u201d) \u2013 this option disables the usual broadcasting of the SSID by the access point, but forces the mobile handset to send requests on all supported radio channels which contains the SSID. The result is that tracking of the mobile device becomes easier since it is transmitting the SSID more frequently.",
