These attacks take advantage of the asymmetric relationship between the processing power used by the client and the processing power used by the server to create a secure connection. In this manner the attacker can make a large number of HTTPS requests on a low provisioned machine to tie up a disproportionately large number of resources on the server. The clients then continue to keep renegotiating the SSL connection. When multiplied by a large number of attacking machines, this attack can result in a crash or loss of service to legitimate users.", "external_references": [{"source_name": "capec", "url": "https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/489.html", "external_id": "CAPEC-489"}, {"source_name": "cwe", "url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html", "external_id": "CWE-770"}, {"source_name": "ATTACK", "description": "Endpoint Denial of Service:Service Exhaustion Flood", "url": "https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1499/002", "external_id": "T1499.002"}, {"source_name": "ATTACK", "description": "Network Denial of Service:Direct Network Flood", "url": "https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1498/001", "external_id": "T1498.001"}], "object_marking_refs": ["marking-definition--17d82bb2-eeeb-4898-bda5-3ddbcd2b799d"], "x_capec_abstraction": "Standard", "x_capec_child_of": ["attack-pattern--6854fe89-0829-429f-a95c-89e77ab6c8ed"], "x_capec_prerequisites": ["This type of an attack requires the ability to generate a large amount of SSL traffic to send a target server."], "x_capec_status": "Draft", "x_capec_version": "3.5"}]}
