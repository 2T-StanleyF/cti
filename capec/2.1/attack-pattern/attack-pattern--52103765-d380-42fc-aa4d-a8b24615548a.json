This information is often needed by the attacker to launch a follow-on attack. This attack is different than Social Engineering as the adversary is not tricking or deceiving the user. Instead the adversary is putting a mechanism in place that captures the information that a user legitimately enters into a system. Deploying a keylogger, performing a UAC prompt, or wrapping the Windows default credential provider are all examples of such interactions.", "external_references": [{"source_name": "capec", "url": "https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/569.html", "external_id": "CAPEC-569"}, {"source_name": "ATTACK", "description": "Input Capture", "url": "https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1056", "external_id": "T1056"}], "object_marking_refs": ["marking-definition--17d82bb2-eeeb-4898-bda5-3ddbcd2b799d"], "x_capec_abstraction": "Standard", "x_capec_child_of": ["attack-pattern--913426fa-ea1f-43b0-8492-1d363ea109d6"], "x_capec_parent_of": ["attack-pattern--fab7fb48-4503-4e03-980f-9bc827be929f"], "x_capec_status": "Draft", "x_capec_version": "3.5"}]}
