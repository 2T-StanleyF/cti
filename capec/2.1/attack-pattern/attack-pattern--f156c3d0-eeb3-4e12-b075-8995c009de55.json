Many websites rely on user-generated content and dynamically build resources like files, filenames, and URL links directly from user supplied data. In this attack pattern, the attacker uploads code that can execute in the client browser and/or redirect the client browser to a site that the attacker owns. All XSS attack payload variants can be used to pass and exploit these vulnerabilities.", "external_references": [{"source_name": "capec", "url": "https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html", "external_id": "CAPEC-73"}, {"source_name": "cwe", "url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html", "external_id": "CWE-20"}, {"source_name": "cwe", "url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/184.html", "external_id": "CWE-184"}, {"source_name": "cwe", "url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/96.html", "external_id": "CWE-96"}, {"source_name": "cwe", "url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/348.html", "external_id": "CWE-348"}, {"source_name": "cwe", "url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html", "external_id": "CWE-116"}, {"source_name": "cwe", "url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/350.html", "external_id": "CWE-350"}, {"source_name": "cwe", "url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/86.html", "external_id": "CWE-86"}, {"source_name": "cwe", "url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/697.html", "external_id": "CWE-697"}, {"source_name": "reference_from_CAPEC", "description": "G.
