This pattern of attack allows the adversary to compromise the application or server via the execution of unauthorized code. An application typically makes calls to functions that are a part of libraries external to the application. These libraries may be part of the operating system or they may be third party libraries. If an adversary can redirect an application's attempts to access these libraries to other libraries that the adversary supplies, the adversary will be able to force the targeted application to execute arbitrary code. This is especially dangerous if the targeted application has enhanced privileges. Access can be redirected through a number of techniques, including the use of symbolic links, search path modification, and relative path manipulation.", "external_references": [{"source_name": "capec", "url": "https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/159.html", "external_id": "CAPEC-159"}, {"source_name": "cwe", "url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/706.html", "external_id": "CWE-706"}, {"source_name": "ATTACK", "description": "Hijack Execution Flow:Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking", "url": "https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1574/008", "external_id": "T1574.008"}, {"source_name": "reference_from_CAPEC", "description": "Silvio Cesare, Share Library Call Redirection Via ELF PLT Infection (Issue 56), Phrack Magazine, 2000", "url": "http://phrack.org/issues/56/7.html", "external_id": "REF-29"}, {"source_name": "reference_from_CAPEC", "description": "OWASP Top 10 2007 (2007), The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)", "url": "https://www.owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Top_10_2007.pdf", "external_id": "REF-30"}], "object_marking_refs": ["marking-definition--17d82bb2-eeeb-4898-bda5-3ddbcd2b799d"], "x_capec_abstraction": "Standard", "x_capec_can_precede": ["attack-pattern--0123fa83-2d47-4398-85f1-30ce114abb9a"], "x_capec_child_of": ["attack-pattern--ce92f5b9-6228-4354-8a1b-72ad7ad3bb84"], "x_capec_consequences": {"Authorization": ["Execute Unauthorized Commands (Run Arbitrary Code)", "Bypass Protection Mechanism"], "Access_Control": ["Bypass Protection Mechanism"]}, "x_capec_example_instances": ["In this example, the attacker using ELF infection that redirects the Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) of an executable allowing redirection to be resident outside of the infected executable.
