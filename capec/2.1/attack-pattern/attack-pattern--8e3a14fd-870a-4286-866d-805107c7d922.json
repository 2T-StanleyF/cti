            "description": "Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is used as a communication protocol between a client and server to invoke web services on the server. It is an XML-based protocol, and therefore suffers from many of the same shortcomings as other XML-based protocols. Adviseries can make use these shortcomings to mount an denial of service attack, disclose information and execute arbitrary code. This includes a SOAP parameter tampering attack in which an attacker sends a SOAP message where the field values are other than what the server is likely to expect in order to precipitate non-standard server behavior.",
