To do this, it takes advantage of inconsistent or incorrect interpretations of the HTTP protocol by various applications. For example, it might use different block terminating characters (CR or LF alone), adding duplicate header fields that browsers interpret as belonging to separate responses, or other techniques. Consequences of this attack can include response-splitting, cross-site scripting, apparent defacement of targeted sites, cache poisoning, or similar actions.", "external_references": [{"source_name": "capec", "url": "https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/273.html", "external_id": "CAPEC-273"}, {"source_name": "cwe", "url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/74.html", "external_id": "CWE-74"}, {"source_name": "cwe", "url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/436.html", "external_id": "CWE-436"}, {"source_name": "WASC", "description": "HTTP Response Smuggling", "url": "http://projects.webappsec.org/HTTP-Response-Smuggling", "external_id": "27"}, {"source_name": "reference_from_CAPEC", "description": "HTTP Response Smuggling, Beyond Security", "url": "http://www.securiteam.com/securityreviews/5CP0L0AHPC.html", "external_id": "REF-117"}], "object_marking_refs": ["marking-definition--17d82bb2-eeeb-4898-bda5-3ddbcd2b799d"], "x_capec_abstraction": "Detailed", "x_capec_child_of": ["attack-pattern--9c983530-1927-43ca-addd-63d149cda4a7"], "x_capec_peer_of": ["attack-pattern--d845a25b-b140-438c-91d7-30b709bb6e18"], "x_capec_prerequisites": ["The targeted server must allow the attacker to insert content that will appear in the server's response."], "x_capec_resources_required": ["None: No specialized resources are required to execute this type of attack."], "x_capec_status": "Draft", "x_capec_typical_severity": "Medium", "x_capec_version": "3.5"}]}
