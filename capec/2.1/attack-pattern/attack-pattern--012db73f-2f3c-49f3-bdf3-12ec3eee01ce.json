Session credentials allow users to identify themselves to a service after an initial authentication without needing to resend the authentication information (usually a username and password) with every message. An attacker may be able to manipulate a credential sniffed from an existing connection in order to gain access to a target server. For example, a credential in the form of a web cookie might have a field that indicates the access rights of a user. By manually tweaking this cookie, a user might be able to increase their access rights to the server. Alternately an attacker may be able to manipulate an existing credential to appear as a different user. This attack differs from falsification through prediction in that the user bases their modified credentials off existing credentials instead of using patterns detected in prior credentials to create a new credential that is accepted because it fits the pattern. As a result, an attacker may be able to impersonate other users or elevate their permissions to a targeted service.", "external_references": [{"source_name": "capec", "url": "https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/226.html", "external_id": "CAPEC-226"}, {"source_name": "cwe", "url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/565.html", "external_id": "CWE-565"}, {"source_name": "cwe", "url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/472.html", "external_id": "CWE-472"}], "object_marking_refs": ["marking-definition--17d82bb2-eeeb-4898-bda5-3ddbcd2b799d"], "x_capec_abstraction": "Detailed", "x_capec_child_of": ["attack-pattern--414d0884-4f46-4a51-b4ea-72125c7f5f9e"], "x_capec_prerequisites": ["The targeted application must use session credentials to identify legitimate users."], "x_capec_resources_required": ["An attacker will need tools to sniff existing credentials (possibly their own) in order to retrieve a base credential for modification.
