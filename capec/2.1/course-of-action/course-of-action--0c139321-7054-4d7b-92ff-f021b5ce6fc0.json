The server responds by returning its own challenge as well as hashing the client's challenge, its own challenge and the pre-shared secret. Requiring the client to respond with the HMAC of the two challenges ensures that only the possessor of a valid pre-shared secret can successfully hash in the two values.", "object_marking_refs": ["marking-definition--17d82bb2-eeeb-4898-bda5-3ddbcd2b799d"], "x_capec_version": "3.5"}]}
