Therefore, any system that relies on existing commercial cell towards will likely be vulnerable to this attack. By using a private cellular LTE network (i.e., a custom cell tower), jamming countermeasures could be developed and employed.", "object_marking_refs": ["marking-definition--17d82bb2-eeeb-4898-bda5-3ddbcd2b799d"], "x_capec_version": "3.5"}]}
