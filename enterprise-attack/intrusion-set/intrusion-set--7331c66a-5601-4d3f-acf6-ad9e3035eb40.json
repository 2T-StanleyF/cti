The group has targeted individuals connected to the Syrian opposition via spearphishing and watering holes, normally using Syrian and Iranian themes. [Group5](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0043) has used two commonly available remote access tools (RATs), [njRAT](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0385) and [NanoCore](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0336), as well as an Android RAT, DroidJack.
