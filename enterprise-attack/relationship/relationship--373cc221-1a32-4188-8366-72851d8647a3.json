Many of the commands used to modify DACLs and file/directory ownership are built-in system utilities and may generate a high false positive alert rate, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.\n\n<h4> Implementation 1 : Access Permission Modification </h4>\n\n<h5> Detection Pseudocode </h5> \n<code> file_dacl_events = filter log_events where (\nevent_id == \"4670\" AND\nobject_type == \"File\" AND\nsubject_security_id != \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\") </code>\n\n<h4> Detection Notes </h4>\n\n- Pseudocode Event ID is for Windows Security Log (Event ID 4670 - Permissions on an object were changed). \n- We need to exclude events generated by the local system (subject security ID \u201cNT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\u201d) and focus on actual user events.\n- When a permission modification is made for a folder, a new event log is generated for each subfolder and file under that folder. It is advised to group logs based on handle ID or user ID.\n- Event ID 4670 also includes information about the process that modifies the file permissions. It is advised to focus on uncommon process names, and it is also uncommon for real-users to perform this task without a GUI.\n- Windows Event ID 4719 (An Attempt Was Made to Access An Object) can also be used to alert on changes to Active Directory audit policy for a system.
