Endpoint sensing or network sensing can potentially detect malicious events once the file is opened (such as a Microsoft Word document or PDF reaching out to the internet or spawning powershell.exe).\n\n<h4> Implementation 1 : Batch File Write to System32 </h4>\n\n<h5> Detection Pseudocode </h5>\n<code> batch_files = filter files where (\n  extension =\".bat\" AND file_path = \"C:\\Windows\\system32*\" ) </code>\n\n<h4> Detection Notes </h4>\n\n- For Windows, Sysmon Event ID 11 (File create) can be used to track file creation events. This event also provides the Process ID of the process that created the file, which can be correlated with process creation events (e.g., Sysmon Event ID 1) to determine if the file was downloaded from an external network.\n- For MacOS, utilities that work in concert with Apple\u2019s Endpoint Security Framework such as File Monitor can be used to track file creation events.",
