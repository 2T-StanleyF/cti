Operating systems may have features to hide various artifacts, such as important system files and administrative task execution, to avoid disrupting user work environments and prevent users from changing files or features on the system. \n\nAdversaries may abuse these features to hide artifacts such as files, directories, user accounts, or other system activity to evade detection.
