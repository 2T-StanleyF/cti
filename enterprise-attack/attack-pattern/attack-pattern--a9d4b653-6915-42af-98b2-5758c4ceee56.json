Bash, the primary macOS (through Mojave) and Linux shell, can control every aspect of a system, with certain commands requiring elevated privileges. \n\nBash scripts (.sh) provide the shell with a list of sequential commands to run, as well as normal scripting operations such as conditionals and loops. Common uses of Bash scripts include long or repetitive tasks, or the need to run the same set of commands on multiple systems.",

If scripting is restricted for normal users, then any attempt to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.\n\nScripts are likely to perform actions with various effects on a system that may generate events, depending on the types of monitoring used. Monitor processes and command-line arguments for script execution and subsequent behavior. Actions may be related to network and system information Discovery, Collection, or other scriptable post-compromise behaviors and could be used as indicators of detection leading back to the source script.
