These interfaces and languages provide ways of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many different platforms. Most systems come with some built-in command-line interface and scripting capabilities, for example, many Linux distributions include [Bash](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004) as a default shell while Windows installations include the [Windows Command Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001).\n\nThere are also additional third-party interpreters, such as [Python](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/006), that may also be cross-platform.",
