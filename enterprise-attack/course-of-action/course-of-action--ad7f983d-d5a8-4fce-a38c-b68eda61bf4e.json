Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing emails with malicious links. Determine if certain websites that can be used for spearphishing are necessary for business operations and consider blocking access if activity cannot be monitored well or if it poses a significant risk. Other mitigations can take place as [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) occurs.",
