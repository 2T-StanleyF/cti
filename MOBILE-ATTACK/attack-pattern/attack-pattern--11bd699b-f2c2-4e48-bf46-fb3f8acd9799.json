An adversary could deliberately insert malicious behavior or could exploit inadvertent vulnerabilities.\n\nFor example, Ryan Welton of NowSecure identified exploitable remote code execution vulnerabilities in a third-party advertisement library [[Citation: NowSecure-RemoteCode]]. Grace et al. identified security issues in mobile advertisement libraries [[Citation: Grace-Advertisement]].\n\nPlatforms: Android, iOS",
