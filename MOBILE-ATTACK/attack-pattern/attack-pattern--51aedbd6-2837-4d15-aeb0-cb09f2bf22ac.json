For example, Xiao describes use of this technique in  [[Citation: Xiao-iOS]].\n\nDetection: iOS 9 and above typically requires explicit user consent before allowing installation of applications signed with enterprise distribution keys rather than installed from Apple's App Store.\n\nPlatforms: iOS",
