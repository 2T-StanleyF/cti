            "description": "If the mobile device is connected (typically via USB) to a charging station or a PC, for example to charge the device's battery, then a compromised or malicious charging station or PC could attempt to exploit the mobile device via the connection.\n\nKrebs described this technique in  [[Citation: Krebs-JuiceJacking]]. Lau et al. [[Citation: Lau-Mactans]] demonstrated the ability to inject malicious applications into an iOS device via USB. Hay [[Citation: IBM-NexusUSB]] demonstrated the ability to exploit a Nexus 6 or 6P device over USB and then gain the ability to perform actions including intercepting phone calls, intercepting network traffic, and obtaining the device physical location.\n\nPlatforms: Android, iOS",
