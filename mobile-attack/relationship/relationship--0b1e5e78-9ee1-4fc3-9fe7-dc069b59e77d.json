[Bread](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0432) has also abused Java and JavaScript features to obfuscate code. [Bread](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0432) payloads have used several commercially available packers as well as hiding code in native libraries and encrypted JAR files in the data section of an ELF file.
