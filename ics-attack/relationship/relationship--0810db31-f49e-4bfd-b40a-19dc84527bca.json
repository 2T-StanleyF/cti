Analysis of the malware by Dragos states that both of the modules have equivalent functionality.(Citation: Dragos Industroyer Jun 2017) The IEC 104 module uses Network Connection Enumeration to determine the Ethernet adapters on the device. Since functionality between the two modules are equivalent, this implies that the IEC 101 module is able to detect serial interfaces on the device.(Citation: ESET Win32/Industroyer Jun 2017)",
