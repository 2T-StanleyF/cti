The malware uses a raw socket to look for connections to a pre-specified IP address, only looking at TCP packets that are 150 bytes or larger. 'ps' identifies and logs on IPs and ports, but not the packet contents on port 502 (Modbus traffic). It does not validate the traffic as Modbus.(Citation: Talos VPNFilter Jun 2018)(Citation: VPNFilter Deep Dive Mar 2019)",
