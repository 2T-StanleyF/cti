            "description": "DP_RECV is the name of a standard function block used by network coprocessors. It is used to receive network frames on the Profibus â€“ a standard industrial network bus used for distributed I/O. The original block is copied to FC1869, and then replaced by a malicious block. Each time the function is used to receive a packet, the malicious [Stuxnet](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Software/S0010) block takes control: it will call the original DP_RECV in FC1869 and then perform postprocessing on the packet data. This secondary thread is used to monitor a data block DB890 of sequence A or B. Though constantly running and probing this block (every 5 minutes), this thread has no purpose if the PLC is not infected. The purpose of the thread is to monitor each S7-315 on the bus. The replaced DP_RECV block (later on referred to as the 'DP_RECV monitor') is meant to monitor data sent by the frequency converter drives to the 315-2 CPU via CP 342-5 Profibus communication modules.(Citation: Wired W32.Stuxnet Feb 2011)",
