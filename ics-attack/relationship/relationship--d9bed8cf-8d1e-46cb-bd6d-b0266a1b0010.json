In other words, trigger a false positive. Triton also can reprogram the SIS logic to allow unsafe conditions to persist.(Citation: FireEye TRITON Dec 2017)The Triton malware is able to add a malicious program to the execution table of the controller. This action leaves the legitimate programs in place. If the controller failed, Triton would attempt to return it to a running state. If the controller did not recover within a certain time window, the sample would overwrite the malicious program to cover its tracks.(Citation: FireEye TRITON Dec 2017)",
