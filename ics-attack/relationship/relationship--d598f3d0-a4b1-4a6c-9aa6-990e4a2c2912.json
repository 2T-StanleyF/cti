            "description": "The Siemens s7otbxdx.dll is responsible for handling PLC block exchange between the programming device (i.e., a computer running a Simatic manager on Windows) and the PLC. s7db_open function is an export hook that is used to obtain information used to create handles to manage a PLC (such a handle is used by APIs that manipulate the PLC). [Stuxnet](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Software/S0010) utilized this export hook to gain information about targeted PLCs such as model information.[Stuxnet](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Software/S0010) was specifically targeting CPUs 6ES7-315-2 (Series 300) with special system data block characteristics for sequence A or B and 6ES7-315-2 for sequence C. The PLC type can also be checked using the s7ag_read_szl API.(Citation: Wired W32.Stuxnet Feb 2011)",
