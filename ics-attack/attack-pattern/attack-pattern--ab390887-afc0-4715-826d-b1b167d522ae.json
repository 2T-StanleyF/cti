Windows processes often leverage these API functions to perform tasks that require reusable system resources. Windows API functions are typically stored in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as exported functions. (Citation: EAttack Hooking)\n\nOne type of hooking seen in ICS involves redirecting calls to these functions via import address table (IAT) hooking. IAT hooking uses modifications to a process\u2019s IAT, where pointers to imported API functions are stored. (Citation: Stuxnet - Symantec - 201102)",
