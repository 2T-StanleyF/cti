These protocols may be used to disguise adversary actions as benign network traffic. Standard protocols may be seen on their associated port or in some cases over a non-standard port.\n\nAdversaries may use these protocols to reach out of the network for command and control, or in some cases to other infected devices within the network.\n\nData Sources: Process use of network, Malware reverse engineering, Process monitoring, Network protocol analysis, Packet capture",
